# Overview

``vtc-rs`` is inspired by years of scripting workflow solutions in a Hollywood cutting
room. It aims to capture all the ways in which timecode is used throughout the industry so
users can spend more time on their workflow logic, and less time handling the
corner-cases of parsing and calculating timecode.

## Demo

Let's take a quick high-level look at what you can do with vtc-rs:

```rust
use vtc::{Timecode, Framerate, Ntsc, rates};
use num::Rational64;

// It's easy to make a new 23.98 NTSC timecode. We use the with_frames constructor here since
// timecode is really a human-readable way to represent frame count.
let mut tc = Timecode::with_frames("17:23:13:02", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

// We can get all sorts of ways to represent the timecode.
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "17:23:13:02");
assert_eq!(tc.frames(), 1502234i64);
assert_eq!(tc.seconds(), Rational64::new(751868117, 12000));
assert_eq!(tc.runtime(3), "17:24:15.676");
assert_eq!(tc.premiere_ticks(), 15915544300656000i64);
assert_eq!(tc.feet_and_frames(), "93889+10");

// We can inspect the framerate.
assert_eq!(tc.rate().playback(), Rational64::new(24000, 1001));
assert_eq!(tc.rate().timebase(), Rational64::new(24, 1));
assert_eq!(tc.rate().ntsc(), Ntsc::NonDropFrame);

// Parsing is flexible

// Partial timecode:
let parsed = Timecode::with_frames("3:12", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(parsed.timecode(), "00:00:03:12");

// Frame count:
let parsed = Timecode::with_frames(24, rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(parsed.timecode(), "00:00:01:00");

// Seconds:
let parsed = Timecode::with_seconds(1.5, rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(parsed.timecode(), "00:00:01:12");

// Premiere Ticks:
let parsed = Timecode::with_premiere_ticks(254016000000i64, rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(parsed.timecode(), "00:00:01:00");

// Feet + Frames:
let parsed = Timecode::with_frames("1+08", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(parsed.timecode(), "00:00:01:00");

// We can add two timecodes
tc += Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "18:23:13:02");

// We can subtract too.
tc -= Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "17:23:13:02");

// It's easy to compare two timecodes:
assert!(tc > Timecode::with_frames("02:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap());

// And sort them:
let mut sorted = vec![tc, Timecode::with_frames("02:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap()];
sorted.sort();

assert_eq!(sorted[0].timecode(), "02:00:00:00");
assert_eq!(sorted[1].timecode(), "17:23:13:02");

// We can multiply:
tc *= 2;
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "34:46:26:04");

// ...divide... :
tc /= 2;
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "17:23:13:02");

// ... and even get the remainder of division!
let dividend = tc / 1.5;
let remainder = tc % 1.5;

assert_eq!(dividend.timecode(), "11:35:28:17");
assert_eq!(remainder.timecode(), "00:00:00:01");

// We can make a timecode negative:
tc = -tc;
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "-17:23:13:02");

// Or get it's absolute value.
tc = tc.abs();
assert_eq!(tc.timecode(), "17:23:13:02");

// We can make dropframe timecode for 29.97 or 59.94 using one of the pre-set framerates.
// We can use an int to parse 15000 frames.
let drop_frame = Timecode::with_frames(15000, rates::F29_97_DF).unwrap();
assert_eq!(drop_frame.timecode(), "00:08:20;18");
assert_eq!(drop_frame.rate().ntsc(), Ntsc::DropFrame);

// We can make new timecodes with arbitrary framerates if we want:
let arbitrary = Timecode::with_frames(
    "01:00:00:00",
    Framerate::with_playback(48, Ntsc::None).unwrap(),
).unwrap();
assert_eq!(arbitrary.frames(), 172800);

// We can make NTSC values for timebases and playback speeds that do not ship with this
// crate:
let mut ntsc = Timecode::with_frames(
    "01:00:00:00",
    Framerate::with_timebase(120, Ntsc::NonDropFrame).unwrap(),
).unwrap();
assert_eq!(ntsc.rate().playback(), Rational64::new(120000, 1001));
assert_eq!(ntsc.rate().timebase(), Rational64::new(120, 1));
assert_eq!(ntsc.rate().ntsc(), Ntsc::NonDropFrame);

// We can also rebase them using another framerate:
ntsc = ntsc.rebase(rates::F59_94_NDF);
assert_eq!(ntsc.timecode(), "02:00:00:00");
```

# Timecode: A History

But first: what is timecode?

If you're already familiar with timecode, it's history, and it's flavors, feel free to
skip this section.

Back in the days of film, a running strip of numbers ran along the edge of the film
stock to uniquely identify each frame, called
[keycode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keykode)

Keycode was essential to the film editing process. The raw negative of a film is
irreplaceable: you loose quality each time you make a copy. Editing film is necessarily
a [destructive process](https://nofilmschool.com/2017/06/editing-on-a-flatbed), and
often required multiple iterations. It would be just a tad nerve-wracking to take a pair
of scissors and some glue to the one-of-a-kind film reels straight out of the camera
on set, then running it over and over through a flatbed.

To avoid potential disaster, editors made their cut of the film using copies of the
raw negative, called a [work print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workprint), allowing
the editor to work without fear of sinking a project from slicing, dicing, and wearing
at the film.

When the edit was complete, it was necessary to know *exactly* where the edits had been
made, so it could be recreated with the raw negative for finishing. A *cut list* would
be written out, with the exact reels and keycodes for every cut, and would be used to
make an exact duplicate of the editor's work print with the mint condition raw negative.

In video and digital filmmaking, the same approach is used. Massive RAW files from a
RED, ARRI, Sony, or other cinema camera are rendered down to more manageable files an
Editor's machine won't choke on. Once the edit is complete, the raw files are
re-assembled using a digital cutlist on a powerful machine for finishing out the film.

In film, we referenced *keycode* to know exactly what frame was being displayed on
screen at any given time. In digital video, we reference the *timecode* of a given
frame.
